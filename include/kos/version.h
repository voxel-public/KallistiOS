/** \defgroup version Versioning
    \brief            KOS version information and utility API

    This API provides both access to the current KOS version as well as
    utilities that can be used to check for or require a particular version.

    ## Format
    KOS's versioning scheme follows the following format: `major.minor.patch`
    where a change in the revision number of any component typically suggests:

    |Component|Description
    |---------|-----------
    |Major    |Massive, sweeping changes to major APIs and subsystems.
    |Minor    |Small, incremental updates and new features.
    |Patch    |Usually simply bugfixes.

    ## Version Types
    The versioning information is split into two different groups:
        
    |Version Type|Description
    |------------|-----------
    |\ref version_comptime|The version of KOS your code is being compiled against.
    |\ref version_runtime |The version of KOS your code has been linked against.

    Ideally, these two versions would be the same; however, it is possible for
    them to differ in certain circumstances:

    - You pulled down a new version of KOS, rebuilt your code, but did not
        rebuild the KOS library.
    - You use dynamically loaded libraries which may have been built
        against different versions of KOS than what you are currently
        linking against.

    ## Version Checking
    Version checks are handled differently depending on whether you want to use
    the version at compile-time or run-time.

    |Version Type|Mechanism
    |------------|-----------
    |\ref version_comptime_check "Compile-Time"|Preprocessor directives, conditional compilation.
    |\ref version_runtime_check "Run-Time"|if statements, conditional branches

    \warning
    It is very important that you use the provided version-check mechanisms when
    comparing two different versions together, as no assurance is made that
    versions can be correctly compared as integers.

    ## App Versioning
    The same \ref version_utils used to implement the KOS versioning
    API are available as part of the public API so that they may be used to 
    implement your own similar versioning scheme at the app-level.
