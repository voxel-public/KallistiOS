- **Dreamcast**: KGL support for the new matrix.s [Andrew Kieschnick == ADK]
- **Dreamcast**: New video.c / video.h with a real mode table, and support for some PAL modes and 256x256! 800x608 is apparently still a bit broken in this one, so if anyone is actually using it you might have to tweak just a bit. [Scav]

- **Dreamcast**: Fixed some dc-load init/shutdown bugs (adk)
- Fixed a bug in the global Makefiles that made it not process the "SUBDIRS" entries normally
- **Dreamcast**: PVR functionality ("ta" module) has been separated into its own subdir, where it will eventually gain more functionality and be reorganized.
- **Dreamcast**: As part of the above reorganization, TA initialization is no longer done automatically; you can do this by adding TA_ENABLE to the call to kos_init_all (see below).
- **Dreamcast**: vid_set_mode() has been simplified to take only two arguments; a new function vid_set_mode_and_cable() is now there if you want to change cable types manually for some reason.
- **Dreamcast**: kos_init_all() has changed to a more flexible format; PLEASE LOOK at the examples to see how!
- **Dreamcast**: Fixed a bug in fs_dcload that made a listing of /pc not work

## KallistiOS version 1.1.1
- Per-thread path functions are back now, if threads are enabled.
- **Dreamcast**: dc-load console and file system support is now integrated
- **Dreamcast**: The startup procedure has changed (i.e., how you initialize the library mode). Please see the dreamcast "2ndmix" example for details.
- **Dreamcast**: MP3 player lib and S3M player lib have been integrated (though the S3M lib is a bit incomplete as of yet)
- **Dreamcast**: JPEG lib, PVR and other utils from DC Tonic's libdemocd now included
- **Dreamcast**: More OS-mode support

- **Dreamcast**: Fixed a problem where some things (hardware, irq) might be de-initted even though they weren't initted (and cause strange problems)
- **Dreamcast**: Libdream examples now ported and included in the DC examples dir

## KallistiOS version 1.1.0
- Complete rework of the entire OS structure. Many of the incorporated changes and cleanups were ported over from the ill-fated KOS-MMU project.
- KallistiOS is now primarily built as a library. It has always worked this way in the past, but now the focus is on the library version rather than the OS version. All non-library-essential items have been moved out of the kernel tree and are currently somewhat broken. These will be fixed over the next couple of releases.
- KOS goes multi-platform! All architecture specific pieces are now moved into the 'kernel/arch' directory.
- A new GBA port was added for Nintendo(tm)'s Gameboy Advance(tm). Not much there yet for GBA, but that will change shortly.
- Everything is now compiled with -Wall and all warnings as of GCC-20010507 are cleaned up.
- New threading module, including proper condition variables, semaphores, and microkernel-style message passing.
- Tiny PCX loading function now included for GBA
- New FS call fs_mmap() added to support using ROM files as const arrays.
- arch_exit() and arch_reboot() added for escape-hatch functionality (if your program is hosed and you know it, call one of these to bail in a nice manner)
- Threading should no longer be essential in any part of the system that does not explicitly depend on it (e.g., semaphores).
- Mutexes have been renamed to spinlocks (which is what they were anyway) and moved into a header file for inlining.
- Serial I/O on DC now times out after a second or so and disables itself
- Lots more that I can't remember!

## KallistiOS version 1.0.0
- Turn off Y scaling on VGA box
- Added render-done interrupt support, to support lower frame rates
- Added rudimentary render-to-texture support
- Added semaphore and mailbox primitives to thread ABI
- Added thd_schedule_next, which the TA routines now use to reduce TA thread overhead to almost nothing
- Added fs_getwd() and fs->getwd()
- fs_romdisk is now case-insensitive
- init.klf now takes an optional command line parameter of the rc.boot name
- Added serial ABI (thanks Brian Peek)
- fs_iso9660 has improved caching now; a separate data and inode cache is kept so that directory info doesn't have to be re-fetched after loading a large file. Also increased the number of cache buffers and got rid of the moronic init_percd() on every file open behavior.
- Fixed bug in fs_iso9660 that caused Rockridge file names to be case sensitive
- Added sprintf in libc
- Kludged around a bug in maple (for now) that would trash thread structures at random (buffer overrun in DMA)
- Added malloc() debugger malloc_debug.c in the 'mm' directory. See that file for usage notes.
- Fixed some (probably irrelevant) memory leaks in startup/shutdown code for KOS
- Added an extra serial_init() call in startup/main.c so that serial output works from the very beginning.
- SVCMPX now fails (correctly) if it hasn't been initialized yet.
- Fix for Gameshark and other 3rd party VMUs that don't properly return an error code when trying to write to the VMU LCD screen (thanks Andrew Kieschnick)

## KallistiOS version 0.90
- Fixed a bug in svcmpx that would return a fake service if you didn't have the named service (thanks to Andrew Kieschnick for finding that one).
- Fixed build on Cygwin for genromfs (thanks Florian Schulze and Brian Peek)
- Fixed bug in bin2o on the cmdline help (I dunno why it worked at all!)
- Updated "goals.txt" document to reflect the changes since before KOS was started. It was still amazingly on-track but there are a few things that have changed since then.
- Inclusion of new "configure" utility for setting up compilation defaults.
- Added new G2 bus module that handles G2 interrupts; will add more later
- Fixed a bug in TA that caused problems with large scenes (thanks Andrew K. again)
- Updated TA to use new G2 module
- Fixed some build things that I found when switching to BSD (this ought to help everyone building).
- Mutexes are now inactive inside interrupts, to avoid a double-fault that causes a reset of the DC. One result of this is...
- BSOD is back (finally), though it only works over the serial port as a general rule.
- Imported BSD's sys/queue.h as bsd/queue.h
- New thread scheduler that uses priority queues and an idle task (so the real thd_sleep ought to work again).
- Fix for trailing '.' in fs_iso9660: some CD burning software adds a dot if there isn't one elsewhere in the filename (thanks Brian Peek).
- Added semaphores to the thread manager.
- Added mboxes to the thread manager.
- Added labels and pwds for threads; labels will be for eventual process listing facilities. VFS uses pwd to resolve relative paths (somewhat). Kosh also now supports this facility.
- Imported lwIP BSD-licensed TCP/IP stack; it's still pretty broken
- Fixes to the RockRidge code (AndrewK)
- load_and_fork() now takes argc,argv also
- Added new userland utility, "init" (see docs/FAQ).
- fs_romdisk now supports directories
- Although this doesn't really affect anything in the code, the naming convention for KOS executables is now to make their extension '.klf' instead of '.elf'.
- Default 'zclip' in TA module is now 0.01

## KallistiOS version 0.80
- Changed the licensing terms to full BSD-style.
- Fixed the "VGA tearing" bug for real this time (scanline int); TA should now be active and work in all video modes (in theory). 800x608 remains "experimental".
- Fixed the "tile 0 bug", which was really stupid: it was just clipping tile 0 as I had requested in the polygon header.
- Added new bin2o util that converts a binary into an object file for inclusion in the link process.
- Tightened thread locking code and irq disable code: there are still some situations where two threads can enter a critical section, but doing it "right" put an incredible load on the CPU. Thus, I just tried to minimize the possibility.
- Fixed a bug in 320x240 setup for RGB cables and VGA offset for 640x480 so it's the same as official games.
- Fixed frame buffer size in 640x480; this prevents the first bits of your texture from showing up on the bottom of the screen.
- Added a new ta_set_buffer_config() so that you can set the TA parameters like active lists and buffer sizes before calling init.
- Integrated Andrew Kieschnick's RockRidge NM extension patches for the ISO9660 file system.
- Added new romdisk file system. This is intended as a general replacement for the old "builtin" file system, though builtin still has its uses too.
- Added conio->check_getch() in Kosh and added support for that to Streamtest; also added conio->freeze() and conio->thaw() so that you can run compliant apps from Kosh now. This is just a temporary hack and will be changed later, but it works for now.
- New upstream version of Streamtest code (from our game).
- Increased default thread stack space again, this time to 64k. Tune to your liking in include/kallisti/config.h.
- Simplistic TA texture allocation system; names of texture_* funcs have changed; please see ta.c or ta.h.
- BIOS font API now supports opaque or not; the bfont_* functions have changed; please see biosfont.c or biosfont.h.
- Added default disclaimer screen for use in bootable KOS applications.
- Included new version of 2ndmix intro/demo and the original song with the romdisk image.
- Added the beginnings of a FAQ.

## KallistiOS version 0.7
- Added some "const" keywords here and there, and made an effort to remove most of the in-block stack variables and in-var initializations. There are still a few in userland programs (jam notably).
- Most things now work with default optimizations (-O1 plus some other things). -O2 seems to work for that matter, but I'm not pushing it yet =)
- Increased max simultaneous open files on /bi to 8
- Fixed iso_seek() for /cd
- Added some thread safety stuff in /pc (serconsole) and fixed some memory leaks in there. It still doesn't work right with threads. Some reciprocal fixes in konsole.
- Added some DMA-safety things in maple (timeouts, etc)
- Added mutex init in maple (oops!!)
- TA has a completely new buffer allocator now that takes texture memory into account. Also texture_map() has changed, all texture offsets should start at zero and will be mapped by TA automatically.
- TA now does almost everything relevant inside its interrupt for improved rendering response time. It also resets after each frame in case the last one didn't finish (this is an improvement from locking up the TA =). The next version ought to properly wait until the render is done.
- Moved several config options (like thread stack size, etc) into config.h
- Fixed a lot of pointer/heap corruption bugs and memory leaks in elf.c
- Fixed memory leak in process.c (ps_load_and_fork wasn't freeing the image)
- Added 'LIBS' var in userland's Makefile.prefab
- Cleaned up a few things in JAM (including removing "required" mouse support)
- Changed Kosh's \r and \n handling to be more Unix-like
- Removed a few debug lines in libk
- New userland program "streamtest" demonstrates the beta streaming AICA driver, and includes a DC/KOS port of XingMP3 from FreeAmp. Note that compiling this program from scratch requires the ARM compiler and a working libm from newlib.

## KallistiOS version 0.6
- First release
